# apc-survival

## To do

- Explore connection between survival models and Poisson regression
  - [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/8117/does-cox-regression-have-an-underlying-poisson-distribution/8118#8118)
    stackexchange answer might be helpful - it’s Cox regression specific
    though
- Use Tutz’s textbook on modeling discrete time to event data to
  identify the connection between discrete and continuous time
- Then build off of Goepp et al’s article “Regularized hazard estimation
  for age-period-cohort analysis” to identify how we could estimate an
  APC model using continuously observed data
- Difference between discrete survival (common discrete times) and
  interval censored (random interval times for every individual)
